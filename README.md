## My Frame Grabber

It is origin from the iOS app of [Frame Grabber](https://framegrabberapp.com/)

I like driving and capturing interesting stuff with my dash cam.  
I need to export the frames from the video recorded by the dash cam.

I encountered the **Frame Grabber** in the App Store of iPhone, and enjoyed it.  
Someday later, I found it's [changed](https://arthurhammer.de/2023/06/frame-grabber-acquired/).  
So this idea comes to my brain, I just want to code myself for this function

I mainly use `Tkinter` to build the visual window, and `decord` to process the frame grabbing task.  
It seems like that I still have a long way to go for developing visual python program.

Actually, this is my first project for my own life after a few years of learning, reading and coding
At least, I complete the function I need.
